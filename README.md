About
--------

Search Party is a hybrid app that takes a user on spontaneous adventures through geolocated scavenger hunts.

Some technologies we used:
  * [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) for component class based data binding and scalable, fast updates to UI
  * [Ionic 2](http://ionic.io/2) for a fast hybrid frontend
  * [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) for maps and distance calculations
  * [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) for real-time data handling
  * [neo4j](http://neo4j.com/) for a highly scalable native graph database with data relationships
  * [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt-nodejs) and [jwt-simple](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwt-simple) for user authentication
  * [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)/[Express](http://expressjs.com/en/index.html) server

Requirements
----

Node v5.8.0+, Typscript, and Ionic 2 beta are required.
 * As of 3/28/16, the line below needs to be added to the typings definition of socket.io.
   ```
   ///<reference path='../node/index.d.ts' />
   ```  
 * As of 3/29/16, the line below needs to be added to typings defintion of moment.
   ```

Getting Started
---------------

SearchParty is super awesome and uses [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/), "the world's leading graph database".  

Here's how to get an instance going on your machine:

[Install neo4j LINUX/MAC Version](http://neo4j.com/download/other-releases/)

Drag into your applications folder

Change filename to be “neo4j-3.0.0-M05” (or whatever the version is)

[Install java 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)


```shell
$ cd Applications/neo4j-3.0.0-M05
$ bin/neo4j start #starts neo4j instance in localhost
$ bin/neo4j stop #if you should want to stop the local instance
```

Make sure that the IP Address in server/db/neo/neo.js matches yours!

Now for the app itself:

Clone the repo and install the necessary node modules:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/EnglishMuffinLLC/SearchParty.git
$ cd SearchParty
$ npm install       # Install Node modules listed in ./package.json
$ cd client
$ npm install       # Install frontend Node Modeules listed in ./client/package.json
$ ionic serve       # Serves up Ionic app
```


Usage
-----

#### `node index.js`
Runs the server (by default found at `localhost:8000`).
